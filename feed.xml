Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>

a database app. It Creates, Reads, Updates, and Deletes database entries. But it
displays them in a nice way with really great animations. The premise of the app
is that, unlike reminders style apps, this app only gives you one reminder per
day letting you know which plants need to be watered that day.</p>

<p>Because of this premise, I had to do quite a lot of complex date math to figure
out which day a plant need to be watered. If your a developer, you know this can
be complex because days and time zones are pretty complex. As well, because I
don’t use a Push Notification server, I need to schedule what Apple calls “Local
Notifications,” This basically means that any time the database changes, I need
to look about 14 days ahead and figure out, for every day, if a plant needs to
be watered and which one, and then schedule 14 notifications. Anyway, I am going
too deep.</p>

<p>WaterMe has been on the app store since 2016 and has gone through many updates
and changes to improve as new features are added into the OS, such as drag and
drop which you can see in the screenshot to the left. Over the years I also
enable Core Data to CloudKit syncing for automatic and reliable iCloud sync
between devices.</p>
