<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>In this article we will cover how to deploy apps from Xcode to an original
iPhone running iPhone OS 2 or 3 in 2025. This will also work with iPhone 3G,
iPod Touch (1st Generation), iPod Touch (2nd Generation). This is the 2nd
article in the <a href="../04/PPC-iPhone-1.html">"Enabling iPhone Development for PowerPCMacs"</a> 
series but this no longer requires a PowerPC Mac. You can use any Mac running
10.7, 10.6, or 10.5 that has Xcode 3 or 4 with the iPhone SDK installed,
including Virtual Machine (if you still have an Intel Mac).</p>

<p>There are a lot of fiddly steps, but I think its important to remember that this
is no different than what every iPhone developer had to do back in 2008. Now
Xcode has been enhanced so much that its all done for you. But back then, these
were totally normal steps.</p>

<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<ul>
  <li>This requires an Apple Developer account (I am unsure if a free one will work 
or not)</li>
  <li>This requires a Jailbroken iPhone or iPod Touch</li>
</ul>

<p>I think it is possible to do this without a developer account. I found a 
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/10763454">StackOverflow post</a> covering how to do 
it. However, they all require the use of a jailbreak tool called 
<a href="https://cydia.saurik.com/codesign.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ldid</code></a>. I have not been able to find 
a copy of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ldid</code> compiled for PowerPC Macs. It might be possible to 
<a href="https://github.com/ProcursusTeam/ldid?tab=readme-ov-file">build from source</a>, 
but I have not tried.</p>

<h3 id="approach">Approach</h3>

<p>We are going to prepare Xcode to sign iPhone apps using the Apple Developer
Portal. Then we are going to  prepare the iPhone to ignore the signature via
Jailbreak. This approach seems strange, but there are 2 sides of the equation.
Xcode will not complete the build process for iPhone apps that are intended for
the device without proper signatures. But then, these old iPhone OS’s are so out
of date that they no longer contain valid Certificate Authorities to trust those
signatures, resulting in them refusing to launch the signed apps, thus requiring
the Jailbreak.</p>

<p>In this tutorial we are going to be basically living in the “Organizer” in Xcode</p>
<ol>
  <li>Modern Xcode also has a window called Organizer, but it is significantly
different now. So you may want to check out 
<a href="https://archive.org/details/professional-xcode-3/page/616/mode/2up">"Professional Xcode: Chapter 22 Using the Organizer"</a>
on Archive.org to read more about Organizer. It actually has many capabilities
you would not expect such as capturing screenshots from the device. The book
also covers <a href="https://archive.org/details/professional-xcode-3/page/628/mode/2up">provisioning your iPhone</a>,
admittedly in less detail than this tutorial.</li>
</ol>

<p>If anyone has advice on how to either not require the developer account to get
Xcode to deploy without a proper signing certificate OR anyone knows how to get
the iPhone to launch the properly signed app without Jailbreak, please let me
know, so I can enhance the tutorial. I think it is frustrating to BOTH need a 
developer account AND need a jailbreak. It should be one or the other, not both.</p>

<h3 id="system-requirements">System Requirements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A Mac or Virtual Machine that is running Mac OS X 10.7, 10.6, or 10.5</li>
  <li>A Mac with USB 2.0 (it might work with USB 1.1 but no promises)</li>
  <li>Xcode 4.X.X, 3.2.X, or 3.1.4 (The screenshots in this article are for Xcode 3)</li>
  <li>Original iPhone, iPhone 3G, iPod Touch (1st Generation), iPod Touch 
(2nd Generation)</li>
  <li>Device running iPhone OS software 3.1.3 or lower
    <ul>
      <li>These devices can easily be downgraded using <a href="https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit">Legacy iOS Kit</a></li>
      <li>Legacy iOS Kit requires an Intel or Apple Silicon Mac or a Linux computer</li>
    </ul>

<h3 id="1-authority-install-the-latest-certificate-authorities-into-your-mac">1. Authority: Install the latest Certificate Authorities into your Mac</h3>

<p>Before any of this will work, we need to make sure your ancient version of
Mac OS X is loaded with the latest Apple Certificate Authorities and 
Intermediate Certificates that Apple uses for signing its development
certificates.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open <a href="https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/">Apple’s PKI page</a></li>
  <li>Download the following certificate files. Depending on your browser you may 
need to hold the Option key while click on them to download the certificate 
files.
    <ol>
      <li>“Apple Inc. Root”</li>
      <li>“Apple Root CA - G2 Root”</li>
      <li>“Apple Root CA - G3 Root”</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Double click on them one by one. In the Keychain Access open panel, it will 
give you a choice of which keychain to add them to. Choose the System 
keychain, not the Login keychain.</li>
  <li>Now do the same for the World Wide Developer Relations intermediate certificates.
    <ol>
      <li>Worldwide Developer Relations - G2</li>
      <li>Worldwide Developer Relations - G3</li>
      <li>Worldwide Developer Relations - G4</li>
      <li>Worldwide Developer Relations - G5</li>
      <li>Worldwide Developer Relations - G6</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now your Mac should trust the certificates issued by Apple.</p>

<h3 id="2-certificate-create-iphone-development-signing-certificate">2. Certificate: Create iPhone Development Signing Certificate</h3>

<p>This is the most tedious part. You should probably make a folder on your system
for storing all of the output of this step, so you can zip it all up at the end
as a backup. This should all be possible on your Vintage Mac via AquaFox
(PowerPC) or ArcticFox (Intel), but I chose to use my modern Mac to do all of
the Apple Portal stuff. This means, you I needed to transfer files back and
forth between the old system and the new system.</p>

<p>Follow the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/help/account/certificates/create-a-certificate-signing-request/">instructions on this page</a> 
to make a Certificate Signing Request. Note that these instructions did not work
for me at first. The Assistant said it had made my request and saved it to the
Desktop, but it had not. To resolve this, I went into the System keychain and
selected the Apple Root CA before starting the the Assistant. I am not sure if 
it matters which certificate you select, but it seems like you need to select
something first.</p>

<p>The way, I could tell that it was going to work is the assistant had the 
checkbox in the UI that says “Let me specify key pair information”. When that
checkbox was present, then the assistant would actually make the Certificate
Signing Request file.</p>

<p>Double click to to add the Signing Certificate to the Login keychain. Note
that the Signing Certificate MUST appear in the “My Certificates” section of
Keychain Access. If you see it in the “All Items” section but not in the 
“My Certificates” section, then Xcode will not properly see it.</p>

<p>This happened to me and I used Gemini to help me fix it. You can see
<a href="/assets/images/retro-tech/ppc-iphone-2/cert8.png">the full conversation here</a>, 
but the summary is that you need to export the private key as a P12 file, 
then delete all 3 certificates from Keychain, then re-add the P12 file and then
re-add the Signing Certificate. That did it for me. I have no idea why.</p>

<p>Now you are going to create a “wildcard” App Identity. Wildcard means we just 
need to specify the base part of the bundle identifier and the part where the
app name goes is just an *. If you are an iOS developer, you may already have
an established base name. But if not, you can just use the Bonjour name of the
Mac you are running Xcode on. I will do that and so it will be
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">local.IchigoDaifuku.*</code>. You will need to type this name into the Info.plist
of every App you make, so make it something easy to remember.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open <a href="https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list">Apple Developer Portal - Identifiers</a> and click the + button next to Identifiers</li>
  <li>Follow the prompts, all the default options are fine</li>
  <li>When it asks you for the bundle identifier click the “Wildcard” radio button

<p>Now you are going to add your device to the Apple Developer Portal so that we
can generate a provisioning profile in the next step.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In Xcode, choose Window→Organizer and then plug in your device</li>
  <li>If you see the Device Error above, then this version of Xcode is not

  <li>Right click on the device name in the side bar and choose “Copy Device

  <li>Open <a href="https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/devices/list">Apple Developer Portal - Devices</a> and click the + button next to Devices</li>
  <li>Go through the prompts and paste in the Device ID when requested</li>
  <li>There is nothing to download after this step, so you can move on to 
provisioning</li>
</ol>

<p>If you got the error above that your device is not compatible, please verify
your device version, the software version, and the Xcode version. These all
need to be compatible to move on. If its an iPhone 4 or lower, then the device
software can easily be downgraded via <a href="https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit#">Legacy iOS Kit.</a></p>

<p>Now you are going to create the provisioning profile. This step combines the
signing certificate (Step 2), the app identifier (Step 3), and the device
identifier (Step 4) into the final step. Please be very careful when going
through the prompts on the Apple Developer Portal as any mistake will make the 
provisioning profile invalid.</p>

  <li><strong>Prompt 2:</strong> Choose the App Identifier you made in Step 3</li>
  <li><strong>Prompt 3:</strong> Choose the Certificate you made in Step 2. The names can be 
pretty vague but I think the bottom one is the newest</li>
  <li><strong>Prompt 4:</strong> Choose the Device you added in Step 4</li>
  <li><strong>Prompt 5:</strong> Give the Profile a name</li>
  <li><strong>Prompt 6:</strong> Download the provisioning profile</li>
  <li><strong>Organizer:</strong> In Xcode, choose Window→Organizer. In the sidebar, select

  <li>Now you can ZIP up all of the uploads and downloads created during this part 
of the tutorial for safe-keeping, in case they are ever needed again</li>

<p>Now you are going to edit the Info.plist and the build settings of your 
application. If you don’t have an application, you can just creat one from the
templates under File→New Project. And yes, you will need to do this any time
you create a new application project.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In Xcode, open Info.plist and change the bundle identifier to match Step 3. 
Type Command + S to save the file</li>
  <li>Open the Build Settings by selecting the project file at the top of the 
Groups &amp; Files pane and then click on Info in the toolbar</li>
  <li>In the info panel click on the Build tab and then make sure the Configuration
and Show dropdowns say “All”</li>
  <li>In the Build Settings panel, look for Code Signing Identity, and choose the 
provisioning profile you created in Step 5 and then close the info panel</li>
  <li>Make sure there is no device connected, then choose Device from the Overview 
dropdown and then click Build and Go</li>
  <li>At this point you might see a Keychain access permission, choose “Always 
Allow”</li>
  <li>Lastly you should see an error appear that says “No provisioned iPhone OS 
device is connected”</li>
</ol>

<p>If you receive the “No provisioned iPhone OS device is connected” error, you
have succeeded, congratulations! You have just gone through the really tedious
task the Apple created for all iPhone developers back in 2008. Now Xcode is 100%
ready to deploy your custom Apps to a real iPhone!</p>

<p>If you see a different error, like a build or signing error, then you have a 
different problem that you need to troubleshoot before you can move on.</p>

<h2 id="tutorial-prepare-the-iphone-to-ignore-the-signature-jailbreak">Tutorial: Prepare the iPhone to Ignore the Signature (Jailbreak)</h2>

<p>This is the part of the tutorial that an iPhone Developer would not have had to
do in 2008. I am not quite sure the reason, but iPhone OS 3.1.3 no longer trusts
the signature we just worked so hard to enable in Xcode. Yes, we had to do it
because Xcode will not deploy Apps to a device without a valid signature. But if
you try to plug in your device and deploy to it right now, you will get an error
telling you that the app could not be installed because there were certificate
issues and it suggests checking the date and time on the phone. I think what
has happened is the Certificate Authorities that Apple used in 2008 have expired
since then and are no longer valid. I tried installing the CA’s from Step 1
of this tutorial on the Phone, but I still got the same error.</p>

<p>Its OK though, because honestly, these old devices are pretty much bricks
without a Jailbreak. Also, jailbreaking is so incredibly easy now thanks
to <a href="https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit#">Legacy iOS Kit</a> by LukeZGD. 
If you use this tool successfully, you should definitely 
<a href="https://ko-fi.com/lukezgd">buy him a Coffee</a> because the script is amazing!
It even helps you enter DFU mode with exactly timed instructions.</p>

<p>I will provide the instructions for performing a Restore and Jailbreak which
will erase everything on the device. However, if your device is a time capsule,
and you do not want to erase it, I totally understand. 
<a href="https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit#">Legacy iOS Kit</a> can also just 
jailbreak it for you. Please see the <a href="https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit/wiki/Jailbreaking-with-Legacy-iOS-Kit">documentation.</a></p>

<ol>
  <li>On a modern-ish Intel or Apple Silicon Mac, open Terminal: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd Downloads</code></li>
  <li>Clone Legacy iOS Kit: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git clone https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit.git</code></li>
  <li>CD into the Directory: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd Legacy-iOS-Kit</code></li>
  <li>Run the setup script: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./restore.sh</code></li>
  <li>Plug in your device and then run the script again: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./restore.sh</code></li>
  <li>Follow the onscreen prompts to Restore
    <ol>
      <li>Please read the prompts carefull and see the screenshots above for a full 
visual walkthrough</li>
      <li>Note that the script will offer to download the latest version of the OS
for you, but if you want to select your own version you can download it 
from <a href="https://ipsw.me">IPSW.me</a></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The device should now be restored and jailbroken. If you can’t unlock it
(meaning it is stuck at the slider that says Slide for Emergency), then run
the script again and it will have an option to attempt activation. If there is
a SIM card in the device, this should work without the Hacktivate option. But
sometimes you have try the “ligher” activation thing 2 or 3 times.</p>

<p>Now you will be installing a special Teak for the iPhone called AppSync. This
Tweak will prevent the process called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">installd</code> from checking for signatures
when Apps are installed. This is critical to installing apps from iTunes,
Xcode, or even Legacy iOS Kit as this one process checks all of them for a 
valid signature before installing.</p>

<p>There is a different version of AppSync for different iOS versions, so see the
<a href="https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit/wiki/Install-IPA-AppSync">Legacy iOS Kit Documentation</a> 
for full details. In this tutorial, I will be showing this for iPhone OS 3.1.3.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Open Cydia:</strong> On first launch, Cydia may need to do a 1-time-setup and then
restart</li>
  <li><strong>Show Sources:</strong> Tap on the Sources tab and wait for it to refresh (it could
take a while)</li>
  <li><strong>(Optional) Delete Bad Sources:</strong> For sources that failed to refresh, delete
them. They will have no icon and if you tap on them, they will have no 
packages</li>
  <li><strong>Add Source:</strong> Tap the “Edit” button at the top right and then tap “Add” at 
the top left and type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://ios3.party</code></li>

achieve our goal! Running your custom app on your vintage iPhone with full
debugger and all the goodies.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open your app project in Xcode, then follow numbers 1 through 5 in the Xcode 
Breakpoint screenshot above:
    <ol>
      <li>① Open <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.m</code></li>
      <li>② Set a breakpoint on or before UIApplicationMain (click in that little 
gutter area)</li>
      <li>③ Make sure the Overview menu is set to run on Device</li>
      <li>④ Click to change to the debugging view</li>
      <li>⑤ Click Build and Go</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Wait 30-60 seconds and you should see your app launch on your phone and it 
will pause at the launch image</li>
  <li>In Xcode you will see the breakpoint was hit, click the Continue button</li>
  <li>On your phone, your app will now be running</li>
  <li>If you see the error in the screenshot above with the selected console output
that means that AppSync from the previous step is not installed or not 
working properly and the iPhone is still checking signatures</li>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Apple always officially required an Intel Mac to do iPhone app development, 
but I figured out how to get the iPhone OS 3.1.3 SDK installed for developing 
Original iPhone and iPhone 3G apps on your PowerPC Mac. This builds upon the
work of whoever in the community created the custom installers and scripts found
on <a href="https://www.macintoshrepository.org/1090-iphone-os-2-2-1-sdk-for-ppc">Macintosh Repository.</a>
This hack relied on the fact that even though Apple required Intel Macs for
iPhone development, they actually shipped universal binaries for the iPhone
SDK up until iPhone OS 2.2.1 SDK.</p>

<p>But the 2.2.1 SDK is quite limited and the iPhone really started to come into
its own with the 3.0 and higher SDK’s. These included critical improvements
like Core Data, AVFoundation, MediaPlayer, and others. So I started to look
into if it was possible to get the new SDK on a PowerPC Mac as well. And to my
surprise, it is possible! And will even deploy to a real iPhone running 3.1.3.</p>

<p>In this document you I will walk you through how I did it.</p>

<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<p>While this does work, there are some fundamental limitations</p>

<ul>
  <li>iPhone Simulator only runs iPhone OS 2.2.1
    <ul>
      <li>This cannot be overcome because Apple only shipped universal PowerPC and Intel binaries for iPhone OS 2.2.1 and lower</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You must have a developer account if you want to deploy to device
    <ul>
      <li>There are probably workarounds, but I just did everything the official way</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Your iPhone must be Jailbroken if you want to deploy to device
    <ul>
      <li>I think this is due to expired certificate authorities on the iPhone OS 3.1.3 but I am not 100% sure</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This Xcode 3 is very old and is not much different than the original Project Builder
    <ul>
      <li>Xcode would not get its new UI style that is still used today until Xcode 4 which only runs on Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard which is Intel only</li>
      <li>The SDK does not support many basic features such as Automatic Reference Counting</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="approach">Approach</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Install Xcode 3.1.4</li>
  <li>Force install the iPhone OS 3.1.3 SDK</li>
  <li>Force install iPhone Simulator.app from the iPhone OS 2.2.1 SDK</li>
  <li>Patch some installed files so everything runs on PowerPC</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="system-requirements">System Requirements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>PowerPC Mac</li>
  <li>Mac OS X Leopard 10.5.8 with all updates installed</li>
  <li>To run on real device
    <ul>
      <li>USB 2.0 (it might work with USB 1.1 but no promises)</li>
      <li>Original iPhone, iPhone 3G, iPod Touch (1st generation), iPod Touch (2nd generation)</li>
      <li>Device running OS software 3.1.3 or lower
        <ul>
          <li>These devices can easily be downgraded using <a href="https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit">Legacy iOS Kit</a></li>

<p>Mount the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iphone_sdk_3.1.3_with_xcode_3.1.4__leopard__9m2809a.dmg</code> and open
the installer file to do a normal install of Xcode. I selected all possible 
options, but you should only need the basic developer tools package. The 
installer WILL NOT let you select the iPhone SDK packages. Thats OK, we will
do that in the next step. This took about 30 minutes on my 1.25GHz iMac G4 
with 1TB SSD, so please be patient if your system is slower and/or does not 
have an SSD.</p>

<p>Note that you must install in the default location <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/Developer</code></p>

<h3 id="2-force-install-the-iphone-os-313-sdk">2. Force install the iPhone OS 3.1.3 SDK</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Verify that the iPhone SDK disk image is mounted with the correct name
    <ol>
      <li>Open terminal and type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -al /Volumes</code></li>
      <li>You should see <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iPhone SDK</code>, not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iPhone SDK 2</code> or some other name. If
its not called exactly <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iPhone SDK</code> then the installer will fail.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Open <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iPhone313PPCInstaller.mpkg</code> and run the installer
    <ol>
      <li>This installs the entire iPhone OS 3.1.3 SDK except for simulators higher
than 2.2.1. Those simulators are Intel only and therefore will never work
on a PowerPC Mac.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Unmount the iPhone SDK disk image</li>
</ol>

<p>At this point you will have a fully working Xcode install and if you will even
be able to create new iPhone projects. However, there are 3 problems that need 
to be fixed:</p>

<ol>
  <li>iPhone Simulator.app will not open because it is Intel only</li>
  <li>The copy of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ld</code> for the iPhone SDK is Intel only</li>
  <li>Interface Builder cannot open XIBs for the iPhone because its plugin is Intel only</li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to confirm that iPhone Simulator is Intel only you can use the 
following terminal command:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ichigodaifuku:~ me<span class="nv">$ </span>lipo <span class="nt">-archs</span> /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Applications/iPhone<span class="se">\ </span>Simulator.app/Contents/MacOS/iPhone<span class="se">\ </span>Simulator

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lipo -archs</code> to check any binary on your system to see if it is
universal.</p>

<h3 id="3-force-install-iphone-simulatorapp-from-the-iphone-os-221-sdk">3. Force install iPhone Simulator.app from the iPhone OS 2.2.1 SDK</h3>

<p>One of the included files is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iPhone221PPCInstaller.mpkg</code>. This file was 
originally provided on Macintosh Repository but I customized it to only install
one small part of the iPhone OS 2.2.1 SDK instead of the whole thing. It only
install the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iPhoneSimulatorPlatform.pkg</code> which installs the Universal binary
version of the iPhone Simulator as well as the Interface Builder plugin for
iPhone XIBs.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Unmount the iPhone SDK disk image (if you didn’t do it already as instructed in the previous step)</li>
  <li>Mount <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iPhone_SDK_for_iPhone_OS_2.2.1_PPC.iso</code></li>
  <li>Verify that the iPhone SDK disk image is mounted with the correct name
    <ol>
      <li>Open terminal and type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -al /Volumes</code></li>
      <li>You should see <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iPhone SDK</code>, not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iPhone SDK 2</code> or some other name. If

    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Open <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iPhone221PPCInstaller.mpkg</code> and run the installer. This installs:
    <ol>
      <li>iPhone Simulator app that is a Universal Binary</li>
      <li>Interface Builder plugin for reading iPhone XIBs that is a Universal Binary</li>
      <li>Runs a script that patches the xcspec files

<p>The normal version of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ld</code> that comes with Xcode is a universal binary but the
the version that comes with the iPhone SDK is Intel only (for some reason). 
Its the only Intel-only part of the SDK, as far as I can tell. I provided a 
script to patch <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ld</code> to make it easy, but all it does is backup the original 
and then copy the version from Xcode into the place the iPhone SDK is.</p>

<p>I wanted to make the script run automatically at the end of Step 2 but I could 
not  figure out how to insert the script into the installer. If you know how, 
please let me know and I will improve <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iPhone313PPCInstaller.mpkg</code></p>

<ol>
  <li>Open Terminal</li>
  <li>Change the permissions to make the script executable (this is not preserved by the zip file)
    <ol>
      <li>Type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod +x </code> note the space at the end</li>
      <li>Drag <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iPhone313PPCldPatch.sh</code> into the terminal window</li>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>

<p>Teskemon was the first app I developed to make heavy use of the new 
<a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/concurrency/">Swift Concurrency</a> 
system. Concurrency is used to ping and check open ports on many network
endpoints at once. That said, Teskemon uses a standard (boring) Model View
Controller approach. There are 3 Swift Packages, Model, Controller, View. When I
make big changes I usually post about it on Mastodon. Following along
<a href="https://jeffburg.social/tags/Tailscale">jeffburg.social/tags/Tailscale</a> if you
are curious.</p>

<h3 id="model">Model</h3>
<p>Contains all the basic model types and the conversion logic from the JSON
provided by Tailscale <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tailscale status --json</code>. These types can all be
considered View Models if you like… they are all meant for the view.</p>

<h3 id="controller">Controller</h3>
<p>Controller contains 3 sets of functionality:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Keychain access logic</li>
  <li>Extension to Process (previously NSTask) to execute the CLI commands
and parse the results. This is all done using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">async await</code></li>
  <li>Property Wrappers that wrap the model complexity as well as the Keychain, 
Process, and Presentation complexity into simple types the views can read from
and write to</li>
</ol>

<p>In order to ensure consistency and live updating across all screens all the time
either AppStorage or SceneStorage are used as an underlying storage primitive.
AppStorage stores settings like custom names and the list of services.
SceneStorage stores temporary information like the list of Machines from
Tailscale, the results of the Service scans, and the presentation state of all
the views.</p>

<h3 id="view">View</h3>
<p>This layer contains all of the views for the application. They are all fairly
simply and mostly consist of Tables or Forms.</p>

<h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>
<p>Teskemon does not access the internet or use any analytics service. There is no 
login or other user information stored. The tailscale CLI does provide your 
name, but it is only stored in SceneStorage and never uploaded anywhere. 
Passwords are stored in the keychain but they are cached in memory 
for performance reasons.</p>

<p>That said, Teskemon is not sandboxed because it uses the Process API (previously
NSTask). Because Process allows the application to run any executable on the
machine, it is not possible to use this API in a sandboxed application. Process
is only used to run netcat, ping, and the Tailscale CLI.</p>

<p>Also, if your employer tightly monitors their network, using Netcat 
to port scan a large number of ports on a large number of machines can cause 
warnings to go off (ask how I know). In those cases you may want to disable 
automatic refresh of Services, which is the default setting.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Apps" /><category term="Apps" /><category term="Hobby" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2024 I started using Tailscale to access my home network remotely.

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>

<p>Hipstapaper was a learning exercise I wanted to learn how to make a
cross-platform application that worked on all of Apple’s platforms, including
macOS. This was a big learning opportunity as I had never made an AppKit based
app before. The TL;DR is that I ended up liking AppKit even more than UIKit and
most of the toy apps I make now are either AppKit or SwiftUI.</p>

<h3 id="phase-1-2016-2018">Phase 1 (2016-2018)</h3>

<p>During this phase, there were no cross-platform UI frameworks from Apple and
there was no Database that had online syncing from Apple. Thus the technologies 
I chose were not ideal, but they were the only way to get the job done:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cross-Platform: UIKit and AppKit UI implementations
    <ul>
      <li>Two UI implementations meant everything had to be implemented and updated
 twice. This was a big pain</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Realm Database: Realm featured powerful sync capabilities that iCloud could
not match
    <ul>
      <li>Realm was a great database, but it was not the platform standard “Core Data”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Realm Sync Server: Realm-powered server running in Digital Ocean
    <ul>
      <li>Running my own server meant that I would never be able to support users for
 free. So this kept the app limited to my own personal use.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="phase-2-2019-2021">Phase 2 (2019-2021)</h3>

<p>In WWDC 2019, Apple introduced Core Data syncing via CloudKit. While Apple
pitched this as their final solution to Core Data syncing, the actual
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/202">session video</a> they
published was so quick, and so information dense that it was hard to follow.
As well, the feature has fundamental limitations, that I think have prevented
it from being very successful.</p>

<p>But with the introduction of Core Data syncing, I worked in Hipstapaper to 
swap out Realm with Core Data. This was no easy task as I had not wrapped
Realm in its own wrapper and Realm headers and tokens needs to be removed
from hundreds of UI files… two times for UIKit and AppKit.</p>

<h3 id="phase-3-2022-current">Phase 3 (2022-Current)</h3>

<p>I wanted to learn SwiftUI and because SwiftUI was finally becoming full-featured
enough to support apps with complex navigation for both iOS and macOS, I decided
to take on the challenge. This required significant updates to the Database
wrapper to support SwiftUI’s dynamic data model. However, it worked. I was able
to delete thousands of lines of platform specific UI code and replace it with
just one SwiftUI codebase. As well, I learned to love SwiftUI. If you can figure
out how to let go and let the data drive your application, SwiftUI is simply
amazing. The way the it dynamically updates when there are literally hudreds
of database changes happening every second (such as during a sync operation)
is incredible. SwiftUI is truly a gamechanger</p>

<h2 id="current-status">Current Status</h2>

<p>I still use Hipstapaper across my devices daily. However, I have never put it 
on the App Store or anything like that as I know it is missing key features
that people will want such as offline reading of webpages. Yes, the link to
the web page is stored offline in the database, but to actually open the web
page you will need an internet connection.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Apps" /><category term="Apps" /><category term="Hobby" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hipstapaper was my very first cross-platform app that works on iPhone, iPad, and macOS]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">WaterMe: Gardening Reminders</title><link href="https://jeffburg.com/apps/2016/04/15/WaterMe.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="WaterMe: Gardening Reminders" /><published>2016-04-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-04-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jeffburg.com/apps/2016/04/15/WaterMe</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jeffburg.com/apps/2016/04/15/WaterMe.html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h2>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>WaterMe is the only app that I have released on the App Store that got any sort
of usage traction at all. It doesn’t have a lot of users, but at the time of
this writing (September 2025) it had 993K total sessions according to App Store
Connect analytics. Since these analytics are opt-in I assume that means its had
about 3M total sessions… which is still not a lot, but for a nice little hobby
app, I think its pretty cool <i class="fa-regular fa-hand-peace"></i></p>

<h3 id="app-store-description">App Store Description</h3>

<p>Never let another plant turn brown again. WaterMe reminds you when to tend to
the plants in your garden:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add your plants into the app.</li>
  <li>Add reminders for watering, fertilizing, etc.</li>
  <li>Get 1 notification every day reminding you which plants need care.</li>
  <li>Take care of the plant in real life.</li>
  <li>Drag and drop the reminder to mark it as complete.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thats it! Every day you’ll get one, and only one, notification that reminds you
to take care of your plants.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Supports multiple kinds of reminders per plant
    <ul>
      <li>Water, Fertilize, Trim, and more</li>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>

<p>WaterMe was the first ever app I wrote that is 100% a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a> 
app. Its just a database app with a pretty user interface placed on top of it.
I also got help from a designer friend to make the watering animation video as
well as the icon. Its written entirely in Swift and UIKit but has gone through
a lot of iterations over the years.</p>

<h3 id="version-1-2016">Version 1 (2016)</h3>

<p>The original version of WaterMe was extremely simple and the Core Data model was
simple to match. You had a plant with a name, photo, last watered date, and
watering interval. The app would then sort them categorize them as needing
“Water Today”, “Water Tomorrow”, or “Water Later.” As this was the days of iOS
10, the user interface was also extremely simple.</p>

<h3 id="version-2-2017">Version 2 (2017)</h3>

<p>This version was a major rewrite where I updated the data model to be more
sophisticated. In v2.0, the data model included a hierarchy that allowed each
plant to contain multiple reminders each of which had their own watering
history. Also each plant and each reminder also had a type. For reminders, this
resulted in watering, trimming, or other. But for the plant this field remains
unusued. But I added it so that theoretically types could be added for other
househeld reminders like clothes or something.</p>

<p>This update took advantage of the new drag and drop support that was
added in iOS 11 to make it possible to perform multiple reminders at once.
Lastly, I changed to the database to Realm in the hopes that I could one day
add multi-device syncing.</p>

<h3 id="version-25-2020">Version 2.5 (2020)</h3>

<p>This version brought few UI changes, but completely changed the database under
the hood. In 2019 with iOS 13, Apple released
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nspersistentcloudkitcontainer"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSPersistentCloudKitContainer</code></a> 
which allowed syncing Core Data reliably via CloudKit. I really wanted to
provide syncing to my users so I started the process of swapping the database
layer. This involved writing a wrapper for Realm and Core Data so the UI would
not know the difference. As well, I had to write a one-time migration capability
that would do the terrifying work of performing the migration.</p>

<p>At this time I also added error reporting using a hacked together (but free)
system built with AWS Simple Email Service. It would just send a JSON payload to
AWS Lambda, and that would use the Simple Email Service to email me the errors.
This way I would know if the database migrations were failing.</p>

<h2 id="version-3-and-beyond">Version 3 and Beyond</h2>

<p>In 2024, I worked on a new version of WaterMe with an all new UI in SwiftUI.
I created it to actually make an Apple Watch version of the app. Its mostly 
complete but other projects caught my interest and I have yet to finish and
release it. I would also like to reuse the UI for the iPhone version as I really
dislike working in UIKit. However, I am not sure if I will get the interest
again to do this work.</p>

<p>I am at a crossing point where I could just let WaterMe fade away due updates 
needed for Liquid Glass or inevitable future changes, or I could keep working
on it. We shall see I suppose.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Apps" /><category term="Apps" /><category term="Hobby" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[WaterMe was my first app that was 100% a CRUD app and has been on the App Store since 2016.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Gratuity: Simple Tip Calculator</title><link href="https://jeffburg.com/apps/2015/01/01/Gratuity.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Gratuity: Simple Tip Calculator" /><published>2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jeffburg.com/apps/2015/01/01/Gratuity</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jeffburg.com/apps/2015/01/01/Gratuity.html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Gratuity was an app I made to learn how to use Swift as well as how to customize
UIKit a lot. Even though it was only a simple tip calculator, I really focused
on the design to make it something unique and easy to use. I focused on how the
iPhone has a great touch screen that makes scrolling so easy. The same was true
on the Apple Watch, where the digital crown makes scrolling just as easy. So
yes, I managed to make a tip calculator that does not use keyboard or keypad
input at all.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Gratuity is no longer available on the App Store, but you can
download the source with the link below. That said, I am not sure how easy it
will be to compile as Swift as well as the Watch Extension API’s have changed
so much over the years.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>

<p>The first app I wrote was before Swift was announced, so it was written in
Objective-C. But with Gratuity I wanted to learn Swift. Needless to say, it was
not the greatest Swift code. Also, it went through the extremely painful “Great
Renaming” when Swift 2.0 came out. Also, I made heavy use of the custom
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UIViewController</code> transition API. Its a big pain in the ass, but it can really
create some beautiful effects. You really need to watch the 
<a href="/assets/images/apps/gratuity/phone/vid-full.mp4">demonstration video</a>
in order to see all of the custom effects I built into Gratuity. All of that
combined meant that the codebase is not beautiful and is difficult to maintain.
But that is often the tradeoffs developers need to make. On one hand, you can
have beautiful and clean code with no frills and on the other, you have a big
jumble of code that gives you the design you seek.</p>

<p>Lastly, at this time WatchKit was brand new and extremely limited. It was
honestly a giant pain to work with and I ended up rewriting the watch UI twice
as WatchKit 1.0 was so limiting, I could barely make the app work at all.</p>

<h3 id="watch-app-version-11">Watch App Version 1.1</h3>

<p>In WatchKit 1.0, the only way to make a list scroll with the digital crown was
to have the list be the only list on the screen. Thus if I had to make every
step of the app a full screen. Also, the List view API did not do cell recycling
as it did on the iPhone. So each list had to be extremely short or else the the
screen would take forever to load. Considering the limitations, I think the
results came out good, but I wanted more!</p>

<p>I am not entirely sure which WatchKit update allowed for the use of picker

the watch app could be laid out like the iPhone app and work in the exact same
way. This was so much better I was able to remove the tutorial I worked so hard
on in v1.1.</p>

<p>I unfortunately retired Gratuity several years ago. There were several reasons
for this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It never got much usage: It was free, but that does not mean people will find
  and use your app</li>
  <li>It was difficult to maintain: Because of the WatchKit extension, it was
  difficult to maintain and test. Especially since the WatchKit API kept getting
scrapped and rewritten by Apple.</li>
  <li>I moved to Japan: I no longer needed a tip calculator <i class="fa-solid fa-face-grin-squint-tears"></i></li>

<p>The QoS feature of the SteelHead was being re-implemented and so it was due for
a redesign. QoS is extremely complex and the design process was long. But it was
an incredible success. Through extensive UX research and design, we proposed a
new mental model for QoS in the SteelHead.</p>

<h3 id="feature-research">Feature Research</h3>
<p><a href="/assets/images/design/qos/feature-2k.png" class="thumbnail"><img src="/assets/images/design/qos/feature-600.png" alt="Screenshot" /></a>
QoS is an enormously complex feature. The first step in the process was to fully
understand how QoS works, what its intended to do, and what is needed to make it
do that. I learned everything from the HFSC algorithm, QoS classes, deep packet
inspection, latency priority, minimum and maximum bandwidth, etc. It got to the
point where the questions I asked of the engineers couldn’t be answered without
looking into their source code.</p>

<h3 id="user-research">User Research</h3>
<p><a href="/assets/images/design/qos/user-2k.png" class="thumbnail"><img src="/assets/images/design/qos/user-600.png" alt="Screenshot" /></a>
After learning everything there is to know about how QoS works, it was time to
speak with network administrators to see how they actually use it. I went onsite
at several companies in Illinois, Montreal, and the UK. The user researcher and
I also conducted remote interviews of many more firms. We learned what they used
QoS for, what issues they had with the current version of QoS, and what they
wanted to do with the QoS feature in the future.</p>

<h3 id="sites">Sites</h3>
<p><a href="/assets/images/design/qos/sites-2k.png" class="thumbnail"><img src="/assets/images/design/qos/sites-600.png" alt="Screenshot" /></a>
QoS needs to know the speeds of every network connection in the system. It needs
to know this so it can adequately divide up resources. Network administrators
have hundreds, or even thousands of locations. And each location can have
multiple network connections. So I created an entire concept around this called
‘Sites.’ Each site has any number of uplinks (network connections) and each
uplink has upstream and downstream bandwidths associated with them. This gives
the QoS system the information it needs on bandwidth restrictions across the
entire network.</p>

<h3 id="classes">Classes</h3>
<p><a href="/assets/images/design/qos/classes-2k.png" class="thumbnail"><img src="/assets/images/design/qos/classes-600.png" alt="Screenshot" /></a>
QoS systems usually have the concept of classes. Classes are sort of like
buckets. The network administrator puts certain applications into certain
buckets, then the system treats each bucket with a certain level of importance.
The most important thing to remember about these buckets, is that giving one
more resources, necessarily gives the others less. Also, putting all traffic
into an important bucket may not be desirable. QoS works by prioritizing
important traffic over less important traffic. If all traffic is marked as
important, it can’t do that. Concerns like this were common from network
administrators. I attempted to produce UI’s that could show some of this
information in a visual way, but in the end, we settled for a fairly simple tree
visualization. A few slides after this, there are some concepts I made for
visually showing class information.</p>

<h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>
<p><a href="/assets/images/design/qos/classes-2k.png" class="thumbnail"><img src="/assets/images/design/qos/classes-600.png" alt="Screenshot" /></a>
QoS classes are like buckets you put Apps into that then get managed by the QoS
system. Rules are the mechanism by which the network administrator puts apps
into the classes. Because SteelHead has incredibly powerful Deep Packet
Inspection (DPI) technology. Specifying apps is very easy. Users can search for
commonly known app names, as opposed to intricate IP address and port mappings.
Also, our team pre-grouped the apps into about 8 groups. Each group contains
approximately 800 applications. The rules can be specified with an individual
app or an individual app group. This makes configuring QoS extremely fast.</p>

<h3 id="profiles">Profiles</h3>
<p><a href="/assets/images/design/qos/profiles-2k.png" class="thumbnail"><img src="/assets/images/design/qos/profiles-600.png" alt="Screenshot" /></a>
QoS profiles are how you connect QoS Classes and Rules and Sites. The
SteelCentral Controller has a birds-eye view of all the SteelHeads on a
customer’s network. We designed the profiles UI to take advantage of this extra
knowledge. We did this by having the network administrator choose a source and
destination site, or group of sites, that each profile applies to. With this
information, the SteelCentral Controller knows how to distribute the QoS
Profiles to all appliances automatically. This simplification makes QoS
configuration far more declarative. This is something we strive for. We call it
‘intent’ based management. Where the network administrator specifies <strong>what</strong>
they want, rather than <strong>how</strong> to make it happen. This is an incredibly powerful
paradigm for the new QoS feature.</p>

<h2 id="experimentation">Experimentation</h2>
<p>As with all products and features, not everything the design team makes, makes
it into the product. Sometimes they’re features that are not needed, sometimes
they are too complex, and sometimes they are just way too cool. Below are some
experiments that I made that never shipped.</p>

<h3 id="qos-class-feedback">QoS Class Feedback</h3>
<p><a href="/assets/images/design/qos/profile-experiment1-2k.png" class="thumbnail"><img src="/assets/images/design/qos/profile-experiment1-600.png" alt="Screenshot" /></a>
Setting the min and max bandwidth allocations for a QoS class is kind of a
guessing game. Set the numbers and see how it goes. In order to alleviate
this, I attempted to create some mockups with configurations that would
advise the user of issues with the classes and tried to summarize their
congestion over time in a visual way.</p>

<h3 id="uplink-variations">Uplink Variations</h3>
<p><a href="/assets/images/design/qos/profile-experiment2-2k.png" class="thumbnail"><img src="/assets/images/design/qos/profile-experiment2-600.png" alt="Screenshot" /></a>
Uplink Variations are a system where the network admin could select
different QoS Class min and max assignments based on the Uplink that was
being used. This is important when one or more network connections fail at a
site. In those conditions, critical traffic needs a higher priority.</p>

<h3 id="dashboard-widget">Dashboard Widget</h3>
<p><a href="/assets/images/design/qos/dashboard-experiment-2k.png" class="thumbnail"><img src="/assets/images/design/qos/dashboard-experiment-600.png" alt="Screenshot" /></a>
SteelCentral Controller has really great dashboards that give an overview of
what is going on on your network. This is one mockups I made of what a QoS
widget could have looked at. It shows the QoS classes. When a class is
expanded, it shows relevant errors and warnings.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Design" /><category term="Design" /><category term="Professional" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Redesign QoS on SteelHead and SteelCentral Controller for greater flexibility and improved simplicity.]]></summary></entry></feed>
