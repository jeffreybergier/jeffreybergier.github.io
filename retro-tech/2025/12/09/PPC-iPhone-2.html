<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>In this article we will cover how to deploy apps from Xcode to an original 
iPhone running iPhone OS 3 or iPhone OS 2 in 2025. This will also work with 
iPhone 3G, iPod Touch (1st Generation), iPod Touch (2nd Generation). 
This is the 2nd article in the <a href="../04/PPC-iPhone-1.html">"Enabling iPhone Development for PowerPC Macs"</a>
series but this no longer requires a PowerPC Mac. You can use any Mac you like
that can install Xcode . This one is quite a bit more involved with a lot of 
fiddly steps.</p>

<p>But I think its important to remember that this is no different than what
every iPhone developer had to do back in the day. Now Xcode has been enhanced
so much that it does all of this for you, but this is what is iPhone 
development required in 2010.</p>

<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<ul>
  <li>This requires an Apple Developer account (I am unsure if a free one will work 
or not)</li>
  <li>This requires a Jailbroken iPhone or iPod Touch</li>
</ul>

<p>I think it is possible to do this without a developer account. I found a 
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/10763454">StackOverflow post</a> covering how to do 
it. However, they all require the use of a jailbreak tool called 
<a href="https://cydia.saurik.com/codesign.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ldid</code></a>. I have not been able to find 
a copy of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ldid</code> compiled for PowerPC Macs. It might be possible to 
<a href="https://github.com/ProcursusTeam/ldid?tab=readme-ov-file">build from source</a>, 
but I have not tried.</p>

<h3 id="approach">Approach</h3>

<p>We are going to prepare the computer to sign iPhone apps using the Apple 
Developer Portal. Then we are going to  prepare the iPhone to ignore the 
signature via Jailbreak. This approach seems strange, but there are 2 sides 
of the equation. Xcode will not complete the build process for iPhone apps that 
are intended for the device without proper signatures. But then, these old 
iPhone OS’s are so out of date that they no longer contain valid Certificate 
Authorities to trust those signatures, resulting in them refusing to launch 
the signed apps, thus requiring the Jailbreak.</p>

<p>In this tutorial we are going to be basically living in the “Organizer” in 
Xcode 3. Modern Xcode also has a window called Organizer, but it is 
significantly different now. So you may want to check out 
<a href="https://archive.org/details/professional-xcode-3/page/616/mode/2up">"Professional Xcode: Chapter 22 Using the Organizer"</a> 
on Archive.org to read more about Organizer. It actually has
many capabilities you would not expect, e.g. capturing screenshots from
the device. It also covers <a href="https://archive.org/details/professional-xcode-3/page/628/mode/2up">provisioning your iPhone</a>, 
admittedly in less detail than this tutorial.</p>

  <li><strong>Cydia:</strong> Install the AppSync Tweak in Cydia</li>
  <li><strong>Provision:</strong> Install the Provisioning Profile on Device</li>
  <li><strong>Run:</strong> Run App on Device</li>
</ol>

<p>If anyone has advice on how to either not require the developer account to get
Xcode to deploy without a proper signing certificate OR anyone knows how to get
the iPhone to launch the properly signed app without Jailbreak, please let me
know, so I can enhance the tutorial. I think it is frustrating to BOTH need a 
developer account AND need a jailbreak. It should be one or the other, not both.</p>

<h3 id="system-requirements">System Requirements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A Mac or Virtual Machine that is running Mac OS X 10.7, 10.6, or 10.5</li>
  <li>A Mac with USB 2.0 (it might work with USB 1.1 but no promises)</li>
  <li>Xcode 4.X.X, 3.2.X, or 3.1.4 (The screenshots in this article are for Xcode 3)</li>
  <li>Original iPhone, iPhone 3G, iPod Touch (1st Generation), iPod Touch 
(2nd Generation)</li>
  <li>Device running iPhone OS software 3.1.3 or lower
    <ul>
      <li>These devices can easily be downgraded using <a href="https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit">Legacy iOS Kit</a></li>
      <li>Legacy iOS Kit requires an Intel or Apple Silicon Mac or a Linux computer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1-authority-install-the-latest-certificate-authorities-into-your-mac">1. Authority: Install the latest Certificate Authorities into your Mac</h3>

<p>Before any of this will work, we need to make sure your ancient version of
Mac OS X is loaded with the latest Apple Certificate Authorities and 
Intermediate Certificates that Apple uses for signing all of its development
certificates.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Apple PKI</th>
      <th>Open Panel</th>

    <tr>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<ol>
  <li>Open <a href="https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/">Apple’s PKI page</a></li>
  <li>Download the following certificate files. Depending on your browser you may 
need to hold the Option key while click on them to download the certificate 
files.
    <ol>
      <li>“Apple Inc. Root”</li>
      <li>“Apple Root CA - G2 Root”</li>
      <li>“Apple Root CA - G3 Root”</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Double click on them one by one. In the Keychain Access open panel, it will 
give you a choice of which keychain to add them to. Choose the System 
keychain, not the Login keychain.</li>
  <li>Now do the same for the World Wide Developer Relations intermediate certificates.
    <ol>
      <li>Worldwide Developer Relations - G2</li>
      <li>Worldwide Developer Relations - G3</li>
      <li>Worldwide Developer Relations - G4</li>
      <li>Worldwide Developer Relations - G5</li>
      <li>Worldwide Developer Relations - G6</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now your Mac should trust the certificates issued by Apple.</p>

<h3 id="2-certificate-create-iphone-development-signing-certificate">2. Certificate: Create iPhone Development Signing Certificate</h3>

<p>This is the most tedious part. You should probably make a folder on your system
for storing all of the output of this step, so you can zip it all up at the end
and then back it up. This should all be possible on your PowerPC Mac via
AquaFox, but I chose to use my modern Mac to do all of the Apple Portal stuff.
This means, you will need to transfer files back and forth between the old
system and the new system.</p>

<p>Follow the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/help/account/certificates/create-a-certificate-signing-request/">instructions on this page</a> 
to make a Certificate Signing Request. Note that these instructions did not work
for me at first. The Assistant said it had made my request and saved it to the
Desktop, but it had not. To resolve this, I went into the System keychain and
selected the Apple Root CA before starting the the Assistant. I am not sure if 
it matters which certificate you select, but it seems like you need to select
something.</p>

<p>The way, I could tell that it was going to work is the assistant had the 
checkbox in the UI that says “Let me specify key pair information”. When that
checkbox was present, then the assistant would actually make the Certificate
Signing Request file.</p>

<p>Double click to to add the Signing Certificate to the Login keychain. Note
that the Signing Certificate MUST appear in the “My Certificates” section of
Keychain Access. If you see it in the “All Items” section but not in the 
“My Certificates” section, then Xcode will not properly see it.</p>

<p>This happened to me and I used Gemini to help me fix it. You can see
<a href="/assets/images/retro-tech/ppc-iphone-2/cert8.png">the full conversation here</a>, 
but the summary is that you need to export the private key as a P12 file, 
then delete all 3 certificates from Keychain, then re-add the P12 file and then
re-add the Signing Certificate. That did it for me. I have no idea why.</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Now you are going to create a “wildcard” App Identity. Wildcard means we just 
need to specify the base part of the bundle identifier and the part where the
app name goes is just an *. If you are an iOS developer, you may already have
an established base name. But if not, you can just use the Bonjour name of the
Mac you are running Xcode on. I will do that and so it will be
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">local.IchigoDaifuku.*</code>. You will need to type this name into the Info.plist
of every App you make, so make it something easy to remember.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open <a href="https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list">Apple Developer Portal - Identifiers</a> and click the + button next to Identifiers</li>
  <li>Follow the prompts, all the default options are fine</li>
  <li>When it asks you for the bundle identifier click the “Wildcard” radio button 
and type in your identifier</li>
  <li>Click “Register”</li>

<p>Now you are going to add your device to the Apple Developer Portal so that we
can generate a provisioning profile in the next step.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In Xcode, choose Window→Organizer and then plug in your device</li>
  <li>If you see the Device Error above, then this version of Xcode is not 
compatible with your device or the OS thats installed on it.</li>
  <li>Right click on the device name in the side bar and choose “Copy Device 
Identifier”</li>
  <li>Open <a href="https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/devices/list">Apple Developer Portal - Devices</a> and click the + button next to Devices</li>
  <li>Go through the prompts and paste in the Device ID when requested</li>
  <li>There is nothing to download after this step, so you can move on to 
provisioning</li>
</ol>

<p>A note on compatibility: 1. Xcode 3.1.4 that I am using only Original iPhone 
and iPhone 3G as well as iPod Touch (1st Generation) and iPod Touch (2nd 
Generation) running iPhone/iPod OS 3.1.3 or lower. But this will change if you 
are running Xcode 3.2.X or 4.X.X. If its only a software version that needs to
change then you can do that using Legacy-iOS-Kit which we will do later. As long
as its iPhone 4 and lower, the devices can be downgraded without issue.</p>

<p>Now you are going to create the provisioning profile. This step combines the
signing certificate (Step 2), the app identifier (Step 3), and the device
identifier (Step 4) into the final step. Please be very careful when going
through the prompts on the Apple Developer Portal as any mistake will make the 
provisioning profile invalid.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Open</strong> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/profiles/list">Apple Developer Portal - Profiles</a> and click the + button next to Profiles</li>
  <li><strong>Prompt 1:</strong> choose “iOS App Development”</li>
  <li><strong>Prompt 2:</strong> Choose the App Identifier you made in Step 3</li>
  <li><strong>Prompt 3:</strong> Choose the Certificate you made in Step 2. The names can be 
pretty vague but I think the bottom one is the newest</li>
  <li><strong>Prompt 4:</strong> Choose the Device you added in Step 4</li>
  <li><strong>Prompt 5:</strong> Give the Profile a name</li>
  <li><strong>Prompt 6:</strong> Download the provisioning profile</li>
  <li><strong>Organizer:</strong> In Xcode, choose Window→Organizer. In the sidebar Select 
Provisioning Profiles and then drag the profile from the Finder into the Organizer</li>
  <li>Now you can ZIP up all of the uploads and downloaded created during this part 
of the tutorial for safe-keeping, if they are ever needed again</li>
</ol>

<p>Now you are going to edit the Info.plist and the build settings of your 
application. If you don’t have an application, you can just creat one from the
templates under File → New Project. And yes, you will need to do this any time
you create a new application project.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In Xcode, open Info.plist and change the bundle identifier to match Step 3. 
Type Command + S to save the file</li>
  <li>Open the Build Settings by selecting the project file at the top of the 
Groups &amp; Files pane and then click on Info in the toolbar</li>
  <li>In the info panel click on the Build tab and then make sure the Configuration
and Show dropdowns say “All”</li>
  <li>In the Build Settings panel, look for Code Signing Identity, and choose the 
provisioning profile you created in Step 5 and then close the info panel</li>
  <li>Make sure there is no device connected, then choose Device from the Overview 
dropdown and then click Build and Go</li>
  <li>At this point you might see a Keychain access permission, choose “Always 
Allow”</li>
  <li>Lastly you should see an error appear that says “No provisioned iPhone OS 
device is connected”</li>
</ol>

<p>If you receive the “No provisioned iPhone OS device is connected” error, you
have succeeded, congratulations! You have just gone through the really tedious
task the Apple created for all iPhone developers back in 2008. Now Xcode is 100%
ready to deploy your custom Apps to a real iPhone!</p>

<p>If you see a different error, like a build or signing error, then you have a 
different problem that you need to troubleshoot before you can move on.</p>

<h2 id="tutorial-prepare-the-iphone-to-ignore-the-signature-jailbreak">Tutorial: Prepare the iPhone to Ignore the Signature (Jailbreak)</h2>

<p>This is the part of the tutorial that an iPhone Developer would not have had to
do in 2008. I am not quite sure the reason, but iPhone OS 3.1.3 no longer trusts
the signature we just worked so hard to enable in Xcode. Yes, we had to do it
because Xcode will not deploy Apps to a device without a valid signature. But if
you try to plug in your device and deploy to it right now, you will get an error
telling you that the app could not be installed because there were certificate
issues and it suggests checking the date and time on the phone. I think what
has happened is the Certificate Authorities that Apple used in 2008 have expired
since then and are no longer valid. I tried installing the CA’s from Step 1
of this tutorial on the Phone, but I still got the same error.</p>

<p>Its OK though, because honestly, these old devices are pretty much bricks
without a Jailbreak. Also, jailbreaking is so incredibly easy now thanks
to <a href="https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit#">Legacy-iOS-Kit</a> by LukeZGD. 
If you use this tool successfully, you should definitely 
<a href="https://ko-fi.com/lukezgd">buy him a Coffee</a> because the script is amazing!
It even helps you enter DFU mode with exactly timed instructions.</p>

<p>I will provide the instructions for performing a Restore and Jailbreak which
will erase everything on the device. However, if your device is a time capsule,
and you do not want to erase it, I totally understand. Legacy-iOS-Kit can also
just jailbreak it for you. Please see the <a href="https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit/wiki/Jailbreaking-with-Legacy-iOS-Kit">documentation.</a></p>

<ol>
  <li>On a modern-ish Intel or Apple Silicon Mac, open Terminal: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd Downloads</code></li>
  <li>Clone Legacy-iOS-Kit: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git clone https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit.git</code></li>
  <li>CD into the Directory: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd Legacy-iOS-Kit</code></li>
  <li>Run the setup script: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./restore.sh</code></li>
  <li>Plug in your device and then run the script again: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./restore.sh</code></li>
  <li>Follow the onscreen prompts to Restore
    <ol>
      <li>Please read the prompts carefull and see the screenshots above for a full 
visual walkthrough</li>
      <li>Note that the script will offer to download the latest version of the OS
for you, but if you want to select your own version you can download it 
from <a href="https://ipsw.me">IPSW.me</a></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The device should now be restored and jailbroken. If you can’t unlock it
(meaning it is stuck at the slider that says Slide for Emergency), then run
the script again and it will have an option to attempt activation. If there is
a SIM card in the device, this should work without the Hacktivate option. But
sometimes you have try the “ligher” activation thing 2 or 3 times.</p>

<p>Now you will be installing a special Teak for the iPhone called AppSync. This
Tweak will prevent the process called ‘installd’ from checking for signatures
when Apps are installed. This is critical to installing apps from iTunes,
Xcode, or even Legacy-iOS-Kit as this one process checks all of them for a 
valid signature before installing.</p>

<p>There is a different version of AppSync for different iOS versions, so see the
<a href="https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit/wiki/Install-IPA-AppSync">Legacy-iOS-Kit Documentation</a> 
for full details. In this tutorial, I will be showing this for iPhone OS 3.1.3.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Open Cydia:</strong> On first launch, Cydia may need to do a 1-time-setup and then
restart</li>
  <li><strong>Show Sources:</strong> Tap on the Sources tab and wait for it to refresh (it could
take a while)</li>
  <li><strong>(Optional) Delete Bad Sources:</strong> For sources that failed to refresh, delete
them. They will have no icon and if you tap on them, they will have no 
packages</li>
  <li><strong>Add Source:</strong> Tap the “Edit” button at the top right and then tap “Add” at 
the top left and type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://ios3.party</code></li>
  <li><strong>Install AppSync:</strong> Tap on “iPhone OS 3 Party”, Tap on “All Packages”, Tap 
on “AppSync for OS 3.1”, tap “Modify”, then tap “Install”, lastly tap 
“Confirm”</li>
  <li><strong>Restart:</strong> After you see the button that says “Return to Cydia”, you can 
tap it and then restart the device</li>

<p>You’re probably pretty tired by now, but hang in there, we are about to finally 
achieve our goal! Running your custom app on your vintage iPhone with full
debugger and all the goodies.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open your app project in Xcode, then follow numbers 1 through 5 in the Xcode 
Breakpoint screenshot above:
    <ol>
      <li>① Open <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.m</code></li>
      <li>② Set a breakpoint on or before UIApplicationMain (click in that little 
gutter area)</li>
      <li>③ Make sure the Overview menu is set to run in Device</li>
      <li>④ Click to change to debug view</li>
      <li>⑤ Click Build and Go</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Wait 30-60 seconds and you should see your app launch on your phone and it 
will pause at the launch image</li>
  <li>No in Xcode you will see the breakpoint was hit. Click the Continue button</li>
  <li>On your phone, your app will now be running</li>
  <li>If you see the error in the screenshot above with the selected console output
that means that AppSync from the previous step is not installed or not 
working properly and the iPhone is still checking signatures</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="congratulations">Congratulations!</h2>
