## Overview

Gratuity was an app I made to learn how to use Swift as well as how to customize
UIKit a lot. Even though it was only a simple tip calculator, I really focused
on the design to make it something unique and easy to use. I focused on how the
iPhone has a great touch screen that makes scrolling so easy. The same was true
on the Apple Watch, where the digital crown makes scrolling just as easy. So
yes, I managed to make a tip calculator that does not use keyboard or keypad
input at all.

### Download

Unfortunately, Gratuity is no longer available on the App Store, but you can
download the source with the link below. That said, I am not sure how easy it
will be to compile as Swift as well as the Watch Extension API's have changed
so much over the years.

## Development

The first app I wrote was before Swift was announced, so it was written in
Objective-C. But with Gratuity I wanted to learn Swift. Needless to say, it was
not the greatest Swift code. Also, it went through the extremely painful "Great
Renaming" when Swift 2.0 came out. Also, I made heavy use of the custom
`UIViewController` transition API. Its a big pain in the ass, but it can really
create some beautiful effects. You really need to watch the 
[demonstration video](/assets/images/apps/gratuity/phone/vid-full.mp4)
in order to see all of the custom effects I built into Gratuity. All of that
combined meant that the codebase is not beautiful and is difficult to maintain.
But that is often the tradeoffs developers need to make. On one hand, you can
have beautiful and clean code with no frills and on the other, you have a big
jumble of code that gives you the design you seek.

Lastly, at this time WatchKit was brand new and extremely limited. It was
honestly a giant pain to work with and I ended up rewriting the watch UI twice
as WatchKit 1.0 was so limiting, I could barely make the app work at all.

### Watch App Version 1.1

In WatchKit 1.0, the only way to make a list scroll with the digital crown was
to have the list be the only list on the screen. Thus if I had to make every
step of the app a full screen. Also, the List view API did not do cell recycling
as it did on the iPhone. So each list had to be extremely short or else the the
screen would take forever to load. Considering the limitations, I think the
results came out good, but I wanted more!

### Watch App Version 1.2

I am not entirely sure which WatchKit update allowed for the use of picker
controls, but this is exactly the update I needed. With this new control,
the watch app could be laid out like the iPhone app and work in the exact same
way. This was so much better I was able to remove the tutorial I worked so hard
on in v1.1.

## Current Status

I unfortunately retired Gratuity several years ago. There were several reasons
for this:

1. It never got much usage: It was free, but that does not mean people will find
  and use your app
1. It was difficult to maintain: Because of the WatchKit extension, it was
  difficult to maintain and test. Especially since the WatchKit API kept getting
scrapped and rewritten by Apple.
1. I moved to Japan: I no longer needed a tip calculator <i class="fa-solid fa-face-grin-squint-tears"></i>
