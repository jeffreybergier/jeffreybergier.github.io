## Overview

WaterMe is the only app that I have released on the App Store that got any sort
of usage traction at all. It doesn't have a lot of users, but at the time of
this writing \(September 2025) it had 993K total sessions according to App Store
Connect analytics. Since these analytics are opt-in I assume that means its had
about 3M total sessionsâ€¦ which is still not a lot, but for a nice little hobby
app, I think its pretty cool <i class="fa-regular fa-hand-peace"></i>

### App Store Description

Never let another plant turn brown again. WaterMe reminds you when to tend to
the plants in your garden:

1. Add your plants into the app.
1. Add reminders for watering, fertilizing, etc.
1. Get 1 notification every day reminding you which plants need care.
1. Take care of the plant in real life.
1. Drag and drop the reminder to mark it as complete.

Thats it! Every day you'll get one, and only one, notification that reminds you
to take care of your plants.

- Supports multiple kinds of reminders per plant
  - Water, Fertilize, Trim, and more
- Easy to see which plants need to be taken care of and when.
- Syncs data across all of your iOS devices via iCloud.
- Supports working quickly with Drag and Drop interface.
- Customize the time notifications are sent every day.
- Care for your garden with your voice using Siri Shortcuts.
- Tip Jar In-App Purchases allow you to directly support the development of WaterMe.
- Supports Split Screen and Slide Over iPad Multitasking.

## Development

WaterMe was the first ever app I wrote that is 100% a [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) 
app. Its just a database app with a pretty user interface placed on top of it.
I also got help from a designer friend to make the watering animation video as
well as the icon. Its written entirely in Swift and UIKit but has gone through
a lot of iterations over the years.

### WaterMe 1 (2016)

The original version of WaterMe was extremely simple and the Core Data model was
simple to match. You had a plant with a name, photo, last watered date, and
watering interval. The app would then sort them categorize them as needing
"Water Today", "Water Tomorrow", or "Water Later." As this was the days of iOS
7, the user interface was also extremely simple.
