excerpt: |
  I would not consider myself the best developer out there, but I enjoy
  developing for Apple platforms. So over the years I have created several apps.
  Some are good, some are bad. Most are a learning exercise for me. The most
  important thing is that I really enjoyed making them. So please enjoy.
