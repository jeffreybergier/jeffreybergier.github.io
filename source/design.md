excerpt: |
  I earned my [Bachelor of Science in Industrial Design](https://design.sfsu.edu/bachelor-science-industrial-design) 
  in 2011 and that gave me the design thinking foundation for all of my
  following jobs such as UX Designer, Sofware Developer, Product Manager, and
  now Quality Assurance Engineer. So while, the design work shown on this page
  is quite old, thats because the design process is now buit into any [App](/apps) 
  work I do.
