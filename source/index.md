I’m a Quality Assurance Engineer and Team Lead in the automotive software
industry here in Tokyo. In a past life, I was an iOS and macOS developer and
teacher in San Francisco. In a past past life I earned my Bachelor of Science in
Industrial Design at San Francisco State University.

In my spare time I still enjoy working on Apps and I am very interested in Retro
Computing, specifically with old Macs, Mac OS X, and NeXTSTEP. I try to share
everything as much as possible on this site and on social media:
